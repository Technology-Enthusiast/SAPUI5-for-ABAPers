## What are the Pre-requistes?
Starting SAPUI5 directly will be a mistake for anyone who does not understand the working of world wide web, how websites load or how they work in the way using what technology. I am saying this because an ABAPEr has spent most of his/her time in SE38/SE80// with limited understanding of these concepts. I am not saying all but many. So I would request you kindly make sure you have done all the pre-requisite before you attend sessions otherwise it get's tough.
- [Understanding HTML/HTML5](#html)
> It is very important to have basic understanding how things are structured when a website load. So request you to kindly do the same by completing below mentioned training at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

- [Understanding CSS](#CSS)
> Once you are done with HTML understanding it makes sense to move to next level which is to beautify your document or site or page. So once you have covered [HTML](#html) then cover the CSS by completing  training at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)![image](../Images/CSS.PNG)

- [Understanding Javascript](#JS)
> Now we understand  HTML/CSS it makes sense to understand how do we make our pages/sites etc dynamic. So watch the complete playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOAyyyj1KNc&list=PLFPD0TdUpypnX-9BkIrE9pODPv90nYacT)
