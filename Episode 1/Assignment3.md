## SAPUI5 for ABAPer's - Session 3 Assignment
- Beautify the list of invoices with amount greater than 500 displayed in green and rest in red
- Add company code and invoice type in the output list if not already done.
- Display user friendly status values for the invoice statuses rather than the code
- Add filter for invoices based on input field.
- Add the option to sort and group by invoice type.
- On click of any invoice item add a navigation to detail page which will show all the fields of the invoices.

## *** Try this ***
- For sorting give a drop down of field names to choose from and sort accordingly.
- For grouping also give a drop down of field names to choose from and sort accordingly.
- Create one more view and navigate from invoice detail to lets say invoice partner page and add the partners detail in inovice.json.
